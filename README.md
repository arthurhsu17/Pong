# Pong
Pong is a classic childhood game of mine, having played it on first windows PC that I've ever owned. The game is so simple yet gave me such genuine memories that are indelible to my rudinentary love for games.

## How to play

It is simple, there are two players and the objective is the get it past the others block (paddle), it is supposed to replicate a game of ping pong. Once the opponent misses the ball, you get a point. The ball bounces off the block when it comes in contact. 

This is a __two player__ game: 
-The player on the left uses the 'W' key to move up and the 'S' key to move down.
-The player on the right uses the 'Up' key to move up and the 'Down' key to move down.
